## Pokemaniac â€“ Proof of Concept (POC)

Welcome to the Pokemaniac POC!
This document provides a complete overview of the appâ€™s current state, including technical implementation, business logic, and whatâ€™s coming next.

The whole documentation is available in [the Github's Wiki](https://github.com/Fabryo/PokeManiac/wiki).


### How to Run the App

Instructions for installing and launching the app locally are available [here](https://github.com/Fabryo/PokeManiac/wiki/Setup).

 * Modular architecture following Clean Architecture principles
 * Fully built with Jetpack Compose
 * Key patterns: MVVM, StateFlow, DI with Koin, etc.
 * Libraries: Retrofit, Room, Coil, Coroutines, Flow, Koin, etc.

The Architecture in detail is available [here](https://github.com/Fabryo/PokeManiac/wiki/Architecture-&-Tech-choices#architecture).

More information about the Tech stack is available [here](https://github.com/Fabryo/PokeManiac/wiki/Architecture-&-Tech-choices#tech-choices).

### Concept & Business Plan
 * A social network dedicated to PokÃ©mon card collectors
 * Key features: card library, friend interactions, transaction sharing, and a future marketplace
 * Monetization options: subscriptions, ads, transaction fees

The whole Concept & Business Plan are available [here](https://github.com/Fabryo/PokeManiac/wiki/Concept-and-Business-Plan).

### Business Features Implemented
 * NewsFeed with friend transactions
 * Friend search and subscriptions
